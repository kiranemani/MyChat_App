# My Chat App  

Admin - Will have the rights to add, remove users and have permission to view users list.

When Admin creats a user, he/she creats a user with password and emailId with 'Default' and Default@abc.com" respectively.

User should change the details on his first login, other wise it will not allow the user into chat room.

Instead of Database, I have used csv file to store the data and pandas to manage data.
